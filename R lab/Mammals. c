a) Find the Pearson and Spearman
correlaton coefcients. Are they similar?
pearson_corr < - cor(mammals$
body, mammals$brain, method =
"pearson")
cat("Pearson correlation coeff-
icient:", pearson_corr, "\n")
Pearson correlation coefficient:
0.9341638
spearman_corr < - cor(mammals$
body, mammals$brain, method =
"spearman")cat("Spearman corre
-
lation coefficient:", spearman_
corr, "\n")
Spearman correlation coeff-
icient: 0.9534986
b) Plot the data using the plot command.
> plot(mammals$body, mam-
mals$brain,
+ xlab = "Body Weight",
ylab = "Brain Weight",
+ main = "Body Weight vs .
Brain Weight")
